[INTRO]

Host 1:

Welcome to EliteKerras, a podcast on saving the planet. I am Prajwal, and I'm here with co-hosts Madhusudhan and Aabiskar.

Host 2:

"Hello, everybody! Today's program will talk about the 3R method: waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. Has it changed our approach toward waste and sustainability?"
The 3R method is very important for environmental care, and it has been in use for many years. We shall explore how each R has evolved and keeps impacting change in our lives.
[PART 1: 3Rs History and Development]
Mod 2: Madhusudhan
Let's think about it: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle didn't come out of thin air. Those ideals have been around since the early 20th century but became mainstream in the 1960s and 1970s as there started to be more factories and consumerism producing trash

Host 1: Prajwal
"That's right! More was purchased, but not all of it lasted. Things were discarded, leading to pollution and environmental decay. By the late 20th century, we began to recognize the fruits of that throwaway society."

Host 3: Aabiskar
Then came the 3R approach, emphasizing recycling. It became clear over time that reduction in consumption and reuse of materials are just as important, or even more so, than just recycling.

Host 1: Prajwal

"It was a major change from waste management to waste prevention."

[SEGMENT 2: Mitigate - Line of First Defense]

Host 2 - Madhusudhan:

Now, coming to the first R, which is Reduce. This is where we, right from the beginning, reduce the waste that's getting generated." The hosts now present their thoughts one after another.

Host 1 : Prajwal

"Right. The most potent R: by cutting down on what we consume, there's less to recycle or throw out. This includes being conscious of our buying, use and waste."

Host 3 (Aabiskar): One example is cutting single-use plastics. People now use reusable bags, bottles, and containers. It's also about lowering energy use, water waste, and food waste.

Host 1: Prajwal

"Reducing food waste helps fight climate change. Studies show it significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. So, reducing waste is about using resources wisely."

SEGMENT 3: Reuse - A Simple, Yet Powerful Solution

Moderator 3: Aabiskar

Reuse is next and one of the best things for the environment. It means finding a new use for what you already have, not just giving something a second life.

Moderator 1:

"Reusing saves items from landfills, which has made upcycling—turning old products into new ones—even more popular." 

Host 2: Madhusudhan "Yes, wonderful how people get creative. Old jars are stored and worn clothes are reimagined, stylishly remade. Reuse extends to the ocean. Not just shoppers, businesses do it." 

Host 1 (Prajwal): "Exactly. Businesses reuse materials in manufacturing, from textiles to packaging. Big brands have programs for returning products for reuse or repurposing, benefiting both consumers and companies." **[SEGMENT 4: Recycle - The Final Step in Waste Management)** 

Host 2, Madhusudhan: "Recycle is the most well-known of the 3Rs. It's what's going to keep all of the trash out of landfills."

 Host 1, Prajwal: "It's not that easy, just putting everything in the blue bin." Recycling requires proper sorting, but contamination is a major issue. 

Host 2 (Madhusudhan): "People still put non-recyclables, like plastic bags, greasy pizza boxes, and used batteries, into recycling bins that end up wasting resources while spoiling the recyclable materials." 

Host 3: Aabiskar, that's true. We need to be aware of what can and cannot be recycled and create international recycling systems. Host 2 (Madhusudhan): "And then, of course, there are the new technologies."
